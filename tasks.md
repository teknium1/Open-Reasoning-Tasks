Name: Mathematical Word Problems

Description: This task involves solving mathematical word problems to evaluate the model's ability to interpret real-world scenarios, extract relevant information, and perform appropriate calculations.

Example(s):
- Example 1:
    Input: Sarah has 24 cookies. She wants to share them equally among her 6 friends. How many cookies will each friend receive?
    Output: Each friend will receive 4 cookies.
    Explanation: To solve this, we divide the total number of cookies (24) by the number of friends (6): 24 รท 6 = 4.

- Example 2:
    Input: A train travels at a speed of 60 miles per hour. How far will it travel in 2.5 hours?
    Output: The train will travel 150 miles.
    Explanation: We multiply the speed (60 miles/hour) by the time (2.5 hours): 60 * 2.5 = 150 miles.
